## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on NUnit, and is a Microsoft MVP for the 16th year
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning how to not work, althought fun and work has been so intermixed.
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on anything fun
- ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with NUnit, we need more contributors
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about whatever you like
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/terjesandstrom/)
- âš¡ Fun fact: I tell people not to add the company name to their github account name, because that is what I did.  The company was sold, and don't exist, anywhere but in my github name. And too late to change that now.  So do what I say, not as I do.
