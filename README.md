## Hi there 👋

- 🔭 I’m currently working on [NUnit](https://github.com/nunit), and is a [Microsoft MVP](https://mvp.microsoft.com/en-US/MVP/profile/a15b80b4-3c9a-e411-93f2-9cb65495d3c4) for the 16th year
- 🌱 I’m currently learning how to not work, althought fun and work has been so intermixed.
- 👯 I’m looking to collaborate on anything fun
- 🤔 I’m looking for help with NUnit, we need more contributors
- 💬 Ask me about whatever you like
- 📫 How to reach me: [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/terjesandstrom/)
- ⚡ Fun fact: I tell people not to add the company name to their github account name, because that is what I did.  The company was sold, and don't exist, anywhere but in my github name. And too late to change that now.  So do what I say, not as I do.
